<h1>Analysis of the Smithsonian Digital Library</h1>
<p>Since the Smithsonian Digital Library is so expansive, this analysis will focus on the <a href="https://library.si.edu/books-online">book collection</a> specifically.</p>

<h2>System Introduction</h2>

	<h3>Context</h3>
<p>The Smithsonian Libraries consists of 21 specialized research libraries that support the Institution’s museums and research centers.</p>
<p>On their website, they state their mission as</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">“The Smithsonian Libraries promotes new ideas through knowledge sharing. We play a dynamic role in advancing scientific and cultural understanding and in preserving America's heritage. Our expert staff and extensive collections are a crucial resource for research and education communities at the Smithsonian, within the United States, and around the world.</p>


<h3>Users</h3>
<p>The Libraries help research and curatorial staff make sense of the vast array of unique items in the Smithsonian system. The Libraries also serve “visiting scholars, educators, students, and others pursuing or advancing knowledge in their fields.” Their online presence and digitization initiative is allowing for a broader reach.</p>

<h3>Content</h3>
<p>The Smithsonian Libraries has a physical collection of over 1.8 million books and manuscripts and ”has over seven thousand rare books, journals and manuscripts online on subjects ranging from advertising and aeronautics to zinc sculpture and Zuni cuisine.” The rare books and scholarly articles available to be read online date back to the 15th century.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<h3>Unique Features</h3>
<p>Most of the books are Public Domain, so they are free to download and use without concern over copyright. There are book collections available on very niche topics.</p>

<h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
	<h4>Pros</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Provides a handy FAQ section to help users navigate the site and resources.</li>
		<li>Offers the ability to refine searches similar to Google’s advanced search.</li>
		<li>The digital copies are beautifully presented and even feel like flipping through an actual book.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Cons</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>It appears the services may be impacted by the government shutdown after October 6, 2025.</li>
		<li>The results from the Search Box and the Library Catalog (SIRIS) are different, so it may be hard to know when to use each function.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Suggestions for Improvement</h3>
<p>My only suggestion would be to add a brief statement on the Search Box results page about what kind of resources the Search Box pulls (for example, is the whole collection searched or just the digitized resources).</p>
