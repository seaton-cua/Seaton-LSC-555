<h1>Seaton System Analysis and Usability Test</h1>
<p>This is an analysis of the current website for the Catholic University of America student paper, <a href="https://cuatower.com/">The Tower</a>.</p>

<h2>Inputs and Outputs of the System</h2>
	
<table>

	<tr>
<th>Input</th>
		<th>Output</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Click anywhere on the top banner of the web page</td>
		<td>Takes user to the home page (consistent on all webpages except the “Subscribe” page)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Click on “Subscribe” in the top menu</td>
		<td>Opens a new tab with a place to input an email</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Type “Israel” into the “Search” box</td>
		<td>Brings up six pages of articles that either had Israel in the title or in the article</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Click “Start Quiz” underneath the “Which classic book should you read?”</td>
		<td>Stays on page, gives four options with an empty box next to each which can be marked with a checkmark when selected and a “Next” button underneath</td>
	</tr>

<h2>Heuristic Review</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Visibility of System Status - When an item is selected from the top menu bar, the system acknowledges the action by underlining the item. When an article title is selected, the title turns from black to red. When a time period is selected from the “Archives” list, it changes from black to yellow. When a page number is selected underneath the article snapshots displayed on the page, the page number and box change slightly (the number becomes thinner and the box becomes bolder), the change is so subtle though that it would be easy to miss. I would recommend making the change more obvious like using color like the others.</li>
	<li> Match Between the System and the Real World - The main term on the page that is not easily recognizable to me is “Quill” on the top menu bar. There is no explanation for what this section is and from looking at the articles listed on the page, it seems to maybe be whatever the writers are interested in or things that don’t fit in the other sections, maybe a combination of Lifestyle and Opinion. “Editorials” is also listed beneath this section in a drop down menu. The home page is broken up into very similar sections: “Editor’s Picks,” “Features,” “What’s New,” and “Main Stories.” While these are familiar terms, it is not completely clear what the difference between these sections are.</li>
	<li>User Control and Freedom - The website offers an easy out of any page by clicking on the top banner and going back to the home page. The top of each page also shows where the user is at on the website and provides links back to previous pages.</li>
	<li>Consistency and Standards - The “Search” symbol (magnifying glass) and the location of the “Search” button/box (in the top right of the page) are consistent with external standards. The layout of the pages and the articles are pretty consistent. Little red boxes are used throughout to highlight the categories of the articles. Yellow is used as a pop of color throughout the website too, but I do not think it is necessarily used to highlight a certain feature. At first, I thought all of the yellow indicated buttons or links, but that is not the case. I think it is used more for aesthetics. Links within articles are blue and underlined, so it is easy to recognize as a link.</li>
	<li>Error Prevention - For the quizzes, there is an option to return to the previous page and change your answer. For comments, it will not submit unless all required fields are filled out. In the “Search” box, I spelled ”Israel” wrong and it did not offer suggestions for corrections or recognize that the lack of findings was related to a misspelled word.</li>
	<li>Recognition Rather than Recall - The top menu bar lists just about any section of a newspaper a user would need to remember, with the exception of “Quill” which was discussed in rule 2. I was a bit surprised that despite not closing the website, the “Quizzes” page did not show my results from the quiz I took. That may have something to do with me selecting “Just use necessary cookies” when I first opened the page though.</li>
	<li>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use - The site does offer efficiency through linking related or referred to stories in the text of the articles, so readers can easily open these articles. The articles open in the same tab; I would prefer they open in a new tab since I could still be reading the original article. There are various ways to find articles to read next: return to the home page, select “Previous” or “Next” underneath an article, or select one from “More Stories” at the bottom of the page.</li>
	<li>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design - The color palette is simple (black, white, red and yellow), ties everything together nicely and creates a clean, professional look. The “Home” page has too much going on in my opinion. It seems like they want “Editor’s Picks” to be the main focus, but the scrolling banner at the top and the “Features” and “What’s New” sections right next to this section are distracting. Some of the articles are repeated in these four sections as well, which seems unnecessary. The other pages are cleaner and easier to navigate.</li>
	<li>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors - If required fields are not filled out to submit a comment, a simple little box pops up that says “Fill out this field” above the first empty required field. The message could be easily overlooked because nothing about it stands out; it is the same color and size as all of the other text around it. It is also only above the first empty required field, not over every empty required field.</li>
	<li>Help and Documentation- There are no help or FAQ sections. The only way I could find to contact someone if I were to have a question was to go to the “About” drop down menu, select “Meet the Staff” and find emails listed for each staff member.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>
<h3>Strengths</h3>
	<ul>
<li>The website and search results are visually appealing.</li>
		<li>The page is easy to navigate, so teachers and students will not need much guidance to use.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
<ul>	
<li>There are no advanced search options such as the ability to filter by date range, section, type, or sort by relevance.</li>
		<li>The first line of the search results is the image information, but I don’t think that is what most people are looking for when they are trying to decide whether to open the article to read further or not.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Comparison of Heuristic Review and Usability Test</h2>
	<p>I think my tester and I had very similar thoughts about the site. We both found it to be a simple website that was easy to navigate. I think it is a pretty attractive website, but he seemed to be neutral on that point. We both desired an advanced search function and a way to put the results in chronological order. We also wanted more helpful information about the articles shown in the results. He also had the same assumption I had about the “Archive” section on the right-hand side, we thought it was specific for the page it was shown on. For example, on the “Sports” page we thought the “Archive” would only show past sports articles.</p>

	<p>My suggestions would be to add an advanced search function with the option to set date range, section, type, and sort by relevance. Under the results, I would suggest taking out the photo credit and instead have just a one or two sentence summary of the article, or like a search engine, show a highlight where in the article the search word shows up in the article. I would suggest the “Archive” on each page match the category of the page. I would also suggest utilizing drop down or expandable menus for the Archive: just show years and have a “+” sign next to the year that would expand to show the months for that year.</p>
